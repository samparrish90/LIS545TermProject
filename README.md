LIS 545 Term Project

The dataset described in this project is an Excel spreadsheet that breaks down the Violent Crime Rate in California 2000-2013. The data includes: year (labeled reportyear); location names (labeled geoname) which are separated as states, then further separated by counties; regions (labeled region_name); and the type of crimes committed (labeled strata_level_name).

The metadata consists of tabs within the Excel file that contain vital pieces related to the metadata as whole (labeled: ViolentCrime, READ ME, DataDictionary, MPO_CountyList, and DataFilteringInstructions). This metadata breaks down exactly what is contained within the dataset and allow for further understand of what a user may be reading.
